Dreams
My favorite color
Seems to be enveloping me
Right there
Let it loose
I felt nothing
Lucid dreaming

Sleep away
All inhibitions
Rest my head
Subconcious visions
Right there
Let it loose
I felt nothing
Lucid dreaming

Fuck your fancy messages
I wish I knew that I was dreaming
Wish I knew that I was dreaming
Wish that I knew

I knew, I knew
Dreaming
I knew, I knew
That I was dreaming

I tried not to wake up
Suddenly I'm making up my moves
And I can't lose
Time to be a ladies man
Time to knock out Peter Pan

It felt so real
Ready for the take off flight
Ready to get in a fight
It ended too soon
Too soon
Too soon

Here I stand
Open wide
Tried to fly
But I was denied

Right there
Let me loose
I felt nothing
Lucid dreaming

Sleep away
All inhibitions
Rest my head
Subconcious visions
Right there
Let it loose
I felt nothing
Lucid dreaming

Fuck your fancy messages
I wish I knew that I was dreaming
Wish I knew that I was dreaming
Wish that I knew

I knew, I knew
Dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
Oh
